            This is my first autonomus vheicle project! In this project
            I build an autonomus boat with cheep components to 
            learn the basics of ardupilot and autonomus navigation.

                The first steps of the project was to figure out the minimal viable product.
                What was the bare minimium to make an atuonomus vheicle?
                <br> <br>
                The most important thing for a boat is that it floats and does not take in water.
                I settled with a big plastic food container, because i knew that they had a water tight lid.
                If the boat where to roll over or loose signal it would not take in water. 
                The compromise was however that I did not have very great hydrodynamics. But again, minimal viablie product. 
                <br> <br>
                Then I also needed a form of propulshun. I choose to have two motors with propellers in the water that could push and stear with diferential trust. 
                These motors was cheep drone motors from Amazon, ment to fly drones and not boats. Therefore it was not an efficient combination, but they had more than enough power.
                The motors also came as a kit with speed controllers which saved me some money as well, and also enshured that they were compatible. 
                <br> <br>
                Next problem to takle was to keep the motors dry but the propeller in the water. I found hobby grade propellershafts on Amazon that i could attach to my motors. 
                Then i could attach the axel sleeve (idk if that's the right term) to the hull with epoxy wich created a waterprof seal. 
                Then the inside of the axle sleeve were filled with grease to prevent water from penetrating in to the hull.
