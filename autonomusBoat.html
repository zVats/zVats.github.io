            This is my first autonomus vheicle project! In this project
            I build an autonomus boat with cheep components to 
            learn the basics of ardupilot and autonomus navigation.

                The first steps of the project was to figure out the minimal viable product.
                What was the bare minimium to make an atuonomus vheicle?
                <br> <br>

                The most important thing for a boat is that it floats and does not take in water.
                I settled with a big plastic food container, because i knew that they had a water tight lid.
                If the boat where to roll over or loose signal it would not take in water. 
                The compromise was however that I did not have very great hydrodynamics. But again, minimal viablie product.

                <br> <br>

                Then I also needed a form of propulshun. I choose to have two motors with propellers in the water that could push and stear with diferential trust. 
                These motors was cheep drone motors from Amazon, ment to fly drones and not boats. Therefore it was not an efficient combination, but they had more than enough power.
                The motors also came as a kit with speed controllers which saved me some money as well, and also enshured that they were compatible. 
                <br> <br>

                <br> <br>
                
                Next problem to takle was to keep the motors dry but the propeller in the water. I found hobby grade propellershafts on Amazon that i could attach to my motors. 
                Then i could attach the axel sleeve (idk if that's the right term) to the hull with epoxy wich created a waterprof seal. 
                Then the inside of the axle sleeve were filled with grease to prevent water from penetrating in to the hull. 
                <br> <br>

                <br> <br>

                In order to drive my motors i needed batteries. I settled with two 3cell 57,72Wh lipo batteries wich could drive my motors for quite some time. 
                I also needed a way to controll my motors so i got a radio reciver that had the nessesary connections. And for a transmitter I choose a Raiomaster TX16S 
                because it has a modular design that can transmit to almost any reciver. 
                <br> <br>

                <img src="..\RadiomasterTX16S.jpg">
                <br> <br>

                With the components that I have gatherd at this point I could make a radio controld boat but not a autonomus boat. In order for it to be autonomus the boat needs 
                to control it self based on feadback about it's sorundings. I needed a controll computer. 
                <br> <br>

                This type of comupter is often refered to as a flight computer because they are often used in drones and airplanes, but thay can esely be configured to control a car or a boat. 
                The main thing that a flight computer has is gyro/accleroometer, gps, compas and telemetry radio. 
                Several of these systems have reduncency wich is important if you whant your plane or drone to not fall out of the sky. 
                In my project the stakes are not that high. 
                If the gyro or gps should fail the boat will still float and I could manualy stear it back to shore. 
                Althoug my project does not need or use all the feachers and i could maybye have done it with much cheeper electronics.
                A flight computer is still alot easyer to configure than programming an arduino to do somthing similar. 
                Because there are already so much software already developed for these controllers it is much easyer to use what aready exixts than to reinvent the wheel. 
                I also plan to use this flight controller on other projects that will use more feachers so it makes sensce to not have to upgrade down the line. 
                <br> <br>

                The flight computer is an Pixhawk 6c mini that is running Ardupilot and the ground software Im using is MissionPlaner.
