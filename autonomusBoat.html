                The first steps of the project were to figure out the minimal viable product. What was the bare minimum to make an autonomous vehicle? 

                <br> <br>

                The most important thing for a boat is that it floats and does not take in water. I settled with a big plastic food container, 
                because I knew that they had a watertight lid. If the boat were to roll over or loose signal, it would not take in water. 
                The compromise was however that I did not have very great hydrodynamics. But again, minimal viable product. 

                <br> <br>

                <br> <br>

                Then I also needed a form of propulsion. I choose to have two motors with propellers in the water that could push and steer with differential trust. 
                These motors where cheap drone motors from Amazon, meant to fly drones and not boats. Therefore, it was not an efficient combination, 
                but they had more than enough power. The motors also came as a kit with speed controllers which saved me some money as well and also ensured that they were compatible. 

                <br> <br>

                <br> <br>
                
                Next problem to tackle was to keep the motors dry but the propeller in the water. I found hobby grade propeller shafts on Amazon that i could attach to my motors. 
                Then I could attach the axel sleeve (idk if that's the right term) to the hull with epoxy which created a waterproof seal. .
                Then the inside of the axle sleeve was filled with grease to prevent water from penetrating into the hull.

                <br> <br>

                In order to drive my motors, I needed batteries. I settled with two 3cell 57,72Wh lipo batteries which could drive my motors for quite some time. 
                I also needed a way to control my motors, so I got a radio receiver that had the necessary connections. 
                And for a transmitter I choose a Raiomaster TX16S because it has a modular design that can transmit to almost any receiver.

                With the components that I have gathered at this point I could make a radio-controlled boat but not an autonomous boat. 
                In order for it to be autonomous the boat needs to control itself, based on feedback about its soundings. I needed a control computer. 
                This type of computer is often referred to as a flight computer because they are often used in drones and airplanes, 
                but they can easily be configured to control a car or a boat. The main thing that a flight computer has is gyro/accelerometer, GPS, compass and telemetry radio. 
                Several of these systems have redundancy which is important if you want your plane or drone to not fall out of the sky. In my project the stakes are not that high. 
                If the gyro or GPS should fail the boat will still float and I could manually steer it back to shore. Although my project does not need or use all the features and 
                I could maybe have done it with much cheaper electronics. A flight computer is still a lot easier to configure than programming an Arduino to do something similar. 
                Because there are already so much software already developed for these controllers it is much easier to use what already exists than to reinvent the wheel. 
                I also plan to use this flight controller on other projects that will use more features, so it makes sense to not have to upgrade down the line. 


                <br> <br>

                The flight computer is an Pixhawk 6c mini that is running Ardupilot and the ground software I'm using is MissionPlaner.

                Before I could make the boat autonomous, I needed to make sure I could steer it as a regular RC boat.
                I connected one battery to two of the ESC's(electronic speed controller) which where connected to the motors. 
                In order for the boat to turn I needed the motors to vary in speed when i steered left or right. 
                With some youtube videos and tinkering I got it to work
                <br> <br>

                <br> <br>

                However these drone motors where spinning way too fast for my boat, so most of the time I had to run them almost at the lowest speed.
                After installing the propeller axle on the "boat hull" I needed to test for leeks. 
                <br> <br>

                <br> <br>

                After I ensured no leaks I set out for the boat's maiden voyage. It was not fast nor streamlined but it worked.

                Before I made it autonomous, I wanted to improve the hydrodynamics, turning and make the propellers submerge more. 
                When testing, the boat leaned a lot backwards which I wanted to improve. I put more weight in the front to balance it more. 
                The result was that the boat bored its way down in to the water. To fix that problem I made a nose of Styrofoam to help the 
                front of the boat come up from the water a bit more. It helped but the propellers where still too close to the water line, 
                and at higher speeds the propellers would take in air and loose "connection" with the water. At low speeds it worked, so my 
                cruising speed became roughly 1 m/s.

                In order for it to be autonomous I had to connect the brains to the eyes and arms. 
                In this case the brains was the flight computer, eyes the GPS and arms the motors. 
                To continue the analogy, you could say that the ears and voice of the boat was the 
                telemetry radio that constantly communicated with my computer. But more technically 
                I needed all of these systems to work together, this was not easy. The ESCs would not 
                communicate with the flight computer and the GPS did not get a good signal. As it 
                was my first time doing anything like this, I felt quite out of my depth. The details 
                are not that important but after a lot of time looking at the Ardupilot guide and 
                troubleshooting for days, I finally got it to work. It could drive autonomous and 
                follow waypoints. But the summer last year, when I did this, was coming to an end and 
                I felt finished with the project. Even though my time ran out that time now I want 
                to come back to the project and to do a v2 of the boat. Everything worked good except 
                the hull design. So that was my first thing to tackle.
